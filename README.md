# PROBLEM_SOLVERS_CENTER
##Mini Project - Completed

## Abstract  
The Problem Solving Center is an online platform that aims to provide a community-driven approach to solving problems. The platform is designed to be similar to popular Q&A website like Idea Connect, but with a focus on solving real-world problems.Users can ask questions related to various fields such as technology, finance, health, and education, and other users can provide answers and solutions to these questions. The platform also allows users to upvote or downvote answers, making it easy to identify the most useful solutions.The Problem Solving Center is built with the aim of creating a comprehensive knowledge base for solving problems. It allows users to search for previous questions and solutions related to their problems, reducing the need for redundant questions. The platform also includes features like tags and categories to help organize questions and make it easier to find relevant information. Overall, the Problem Solving Center is designed to be a collaborative platform for solving real-world problems. It leverages the collective knowledge of the community to provide solutions that are not only effective but also backed by real-world experience.

## Problem Definition 
The next step in problem solving is to formally define the problem to be addressed. This is a negotiation between the individuals tasked with solving the problem and the individuals who over-see their work. Essentially, the parties need to come to an agreement on what a solution to the problem will look like. Are the overseers anticipating an implementation plan, a fully operational production line, a recommendation for capital investment, or a new product design? What metrics are considered important-cycle time, material costs, market share, scrap rates, or warranty costs? Complex problems may be broken down into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive components, allowing each piece to be addressed separately. The negotiation should recognize that the scope of the problem that is defined will drive the resource requirements of the problem solvers. The more focused the problem definition, the fewer resources necessary to generate a solution. Finally, the time frame for problem analysis should also be established. Many business problems require an expedited or emergency response. This may mean that the problem solvers need to generate a temporary or interim solution to the problem before they can fully explore the underlying causes of the problem.

## System Overview
Sometimes, it is not enough to just cope with the problems – they need to be solved.Most people engage in problem solving every day. It occurs automatically for many of the small decisions that need to be made on a daily basis.
For example, when making a decision about whether to get up now or sleep in for an extra 10 minutes, the possible choices and the relative risks and benefits of obeying the alarm clock or sleeping later come automatically to mind.
Larger problems are addressed in a similar way. For example: “I have tasks that need to be done by the end of the week. How am I going to get them all done on time?”
After considering the possible strategies, 1 is chosen and implemented. If it proves to be ineffective, a different strategy is tried.
People who can define problems, consider options, make choices, and implement a plan have all the basic skills required for effective problem solving.
Sometimes following a step-by-step procedure for defining problems, generating solutions, and implementing solutions can make the process of problem solving seem less overwhelming.
Six step guides to help you solve problems-:
1.	Identify and define the problem
2.	Generate possible solutions
3.	Evaluate alternatives
4.	Decide on a solution    
5.	Implement the solution
6.	Evaluate the outcome

## Conclusion
Problem-solving applications provide a platform for users to seek answers to questions and share knowledge to find solutions to problems. These applications usually allow users to ask and answer questions related to specific topics, such as programming or general knowledge. Users can vote for answers that they find helpful, and those with the highest votes appear at the top of the list, making it easier for others to find a solution to a particular problem. Additionally, these applications provide a community-driven approach to problem-solving, where users can connect with experts and professionals to collaborate and solve problems together. Overall, problem-solving applications have become an essential tool for people seeking information and solutions to problems in their personal and professional lives.
